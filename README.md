# Python-Roulette
This project, created as the final assignment for the Programming I course, is a simulation of the classic casino roulette game. Built using Python, the game allows users to place bets, spin the wheel, and view results based on randomly generated numbers. It provides an interactive and engaging experience, demonstrating fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and random number generation.
